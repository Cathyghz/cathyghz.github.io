I graduated from **The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China (RDFZ)** in 2024, and I am currently a second-year undergraduate majoring in **Computational Linguistics** at **Peking University**. I plan to pursue a second major in **Intelligent Science and Technology**.

I am currently a **research intern at THU-KEG**, mentored by [Zijun Yao](https://zijun-yao.github.io/)

My research interests include:

- Interpretability of large language models  
- Sparse Auto-Encoders (SAE)  

Feel free to explore my work in the *Publications* section or reach me via email: **cathyghz@gmail.com**.
